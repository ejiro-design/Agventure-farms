To meet the demands of a growing population more food will need to be produced in the next 30 years
than has been produced in the last 10,000 years.
By the year 2050 the human population is expected to reach 9.8 billion and farmers will have to produce 65% more food to feed a population of that size. Unfortunately, most available farmland is already being farmed and in ways that that will ultimately make the land unsuitable for farming in the future. Over the last 40 years we have lost 30% of available arable land courtesy of over-farming and soil degradation.
Farming continues to disrupt more ecological processes than anything else, it is undoubtedly the most destructive process on earth. As farming destroys one tract of land, we are forced to find space to grow elsewhere. In the past half century or so, 700,000 square miles of Brazilian rainforest has been cleared to make way for new farmland.
The ecological impact of farming is not just restricted to our lands but also to our seas. When excess fertilizer and pesticide wash into water bodies the result is dead aquatic zones. There are currently 405 dead zones around the world covering over 150,000 square miles of ocean which are now completely void of life.
Another significant problem posed by conventional farming methods is the damage to human health, the same pesticides that are designed to kill insects are also incredibly dangerous to us. Most produce available today contains traces of these harmful pesticides. Scientific studies have shown that pesticides are linked to wide range of deadly illnesses and cancers.
As vertical farms do not use pesticides or harmful chemicals, produce grown is tastier, more nutrient dense but most importantly, safer. Perhaps though, the best reason to consider converting a signification portion of our farming process to vertical farms is to give our planet time to heal and restore its life sustaining eco systems for the benefit of future generations.
